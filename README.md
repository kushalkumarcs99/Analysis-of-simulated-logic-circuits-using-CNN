# Analysis-of-simulated-logic-circuits-using-CNN

The main objective is to develop a solution using image process/ML techniques which
can analyze two snapshots, read a chart which is given in the form of images, compare
them and returns the discrepancies.
The solution should work on Windows platform Win7 and above OS, any 3rd party
components must be free of cost and free to distribute for internal R&D. Expected
output from the solution should be within 5 seconds
output from the solution should be within 5 seconds
